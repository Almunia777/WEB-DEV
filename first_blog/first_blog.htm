	<h1>Something About Me!!!</h1>
	<p class="line">Hey there! I am Saptarshi Datta and I am a 5' 7'' guy born in West Bengal. So basically I am 21 years old and currently I am pursuing Computer Science Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology(VIT, Chennai Campus).</p>
    <p>Speaking more about my past, I was born at a small town close to Kolkata, named as Kalyani and since then Chennai has been my 4th city to stay in for thhe purpose of studying. While studying 10th I was in a town named as Berhampore which is quite far from the state capital, Kolkata. Then I moved to Kolkata finally for my 12th, and then to Chennai for college.</p>
    <p>Anyway currently the pandemic situation has got me locked back at my home and could experience my college life outside West Bengal for only about a year. Anyway, currently I am hustling from home and trying to make through all the ups and downs of college exams and assignments. At the end I try to enjoy each and every day through my hobbies of listening to music and playing piano, whenever I get time between my everything.</p>
